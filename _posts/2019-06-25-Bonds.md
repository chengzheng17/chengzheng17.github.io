## BASIC OF BONDS

In the bond space, when mention a change in 5-year bond yield, the change may not be referring to the same 5-year bond.  
> * on-the-run bond: newly auctioned bond
> * off-the-run bond: older auctioned bond, double off-the-run etc

The Treasury bond yield curve consists of on-the-run Treasury bond yield, which represents the prevailing market interest rate. 

## RISKS EMBEDDE IN FIXED INCOME INSTRUMENTS

> * Inflation risk
> * Financing/liquidity risk
> * Tax risk
> * Regulatory risk

### Interest Rate Risk

The interest rate that the fixed rate bond is sensitive to is always the rate being offered in the market on similar instruments. A 10-year U.S. corporate bond will not be sensitive to changes in rates offered by 5-year Korean government bonds. But in financial world, interests are highly correlated, making it crucial to track global flows and developments to effectively manage the interest rate risk.

## YIELD CURVE

In the Treasury market and other high-quality bond credit bond markets, yields are the standard way of comparing bonds. It's also called internal rate of return of a bond, enabled the comparison of bonds with different maturities.  

By placing bonds of different maturities on a level playing field, here comes the yield curve, which can help us see the state of the market. The yield curve can be thought of as the **price of lending (borrowing)** money over different points in time.  

> upward sloping yield curve theory: 
> * term premium: investors prefer short-term investment than long-term
> * expectations: market expectations for IR in the future, which is useful in judging state of the economy
> * segmentation: certain investor classes prefer to invest in certain maturity ranges

In sum, the yield curve is likely a mix of market expectations as well as some risk aversion, while certain niche sectors may feel the effects of segmentation.

## DURATION

When investing in bond, It is crucial to adjust oneâ€™s mind-set in fixed income markets to think about risk rather than notional exposure, given the vastly different risk exposure of different maturity bonds. **Carry and rolldown**, instead of price, are the reason for fixed income investment. 

1. *Macaulay duration*, which is weighted time of cash flows. It is roughly the time it takes to recover half the cash flows of the security
> $D_{MC} = 1 \times (c/2)/(1+r/2)^1 + 2 \times (c/2)/(1+r/2)^2 + ... + t \times (c/2)/(1+r/2)^{n\times 2} $

2. *Modified duration*, which is calculated as Macaulay duration divided by 1 +
yield to maturity of the bond.  
> If Modified duration for a 10y bond is 8.0, then 1% move in the yield will cause price to change $8.  

3. *DV01*, modified duration $\times$ price.  

Finally, since fixed income trades are normally quoted in the yield term, it's normal to convert up-front cash flow to a running cash flow: 
> per-year amount = up-front amount/ Macaulay duration  

The concept of duration can be thought of as a **linear effect** on P/L for changes in yields.

## CONVEXITY

The reasoning behind the presence of convexity in bonds stems from the **nature of discounting**. For any cash flow in the future, the value today is reduced to account for the prevailing interest rate.

The links among volatility, convexity, and asymmetry of payoffs are crucial to understand as we are in a volatile market and consider more complicated bond products and especially options.

The second-order approximation for bond price:  
> $P = \Delta \times \Delta y + 1/2 \times C \times (\Delta y)^2 ...$  
Where  
$P$ = price, $D$ = duration, $C$ = convexity, $\Delta y$ = change in yield

The formula for convexity: 
> $C = 1/\[P \times (1+y)^2 \] \times \sum_{t=1}^{to N} {\[C \times (t^2+t)/(1+y)^2 \]}$

## BASIC OF BONDS

In the bond space, when mention a change in 5-year bond yield, the change may not be referring to the same 5-year bond. 
> * on-the-run bond: newly auctioned bond
> * off-the-run bond: older auctioned bond, double off-the-run etc

The Treasury bond yield curve consists of on-the-run Treasury bond yield, which represents the prevailing market interest rate.

> * Tax risk
> * Regulatory risk

### Interest Rate Risk

The interest rate that the fixed rate bond is sensitive to is always the rate being offered in the market on similar instruments. A 10-year U.S. corporate bond will not be sensitive to changes in rates offered by 5-year Korean government bonds. But in financial world, interests are highly correlated, making it crucial to track global flows and developments to effectively manage the interest rate risk.

## YIELD CURVE

In the Treasury market and other high-quality bond credit bond markets, yields are the standard way of comparing bonds. It's also called internal rate of return of a bond, enabled the comparison of bonds with different maturities.  

By placing bonds of different maturities on a level playing field, here comes the yield curve, which can help us see the state of the market. The yield curve can be thought of as the **price of lending (borrowing)** money over different points in time.  

> upward sloping yield curve theory: 
> * term premium: investors prefer short-term investment than long-term
> * expectations: market expectations for IR in the future, which is useful in judging state of the economy
> * segmentation: certain investor classes prefer to invest in certain maturity ranges

In sum, the yield curve is likely a mix of market expectations as well as some risk aversion, while certain niche sectors may feel the effects of segmentation.

## DURATION

When investing in bond, It is crucial to adjust oneâ€™s mind-set in fixed income markets to think about risk rather than notional exposure, given the vastly different risk exposure of different maturity bonds. **Carry and rolldown**, instead of price, are the reason for fixed income investment.

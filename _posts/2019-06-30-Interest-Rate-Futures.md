> Forward and futures help to reduce **exposure to volatility**

## BASICS OF FUTURES TRANSACTIONS

An attractive feature of the futures markets is the ability for a buyer or seller to get large exposure to the market with little up-front cash. The leverage can also be achieved by using **repo market**, to buy bonds on margin.

The arbitrage in bond futures market: For the buyer of a futures contract to be indifferent between owning a forward contract or the underlying asset, the price of this forward contract should be the current price of the asset minus the net cost of holding the asset (coupon - repo) between today and the forward date. But reality is not always perfect. 

In the U.S. fixed income space, there're two majot futures contracts: ***Eurodollar futures*** and ***Treasury futures***, both of which are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). See the symbols system below.

## TREASURY FUTURES

When trading Treasury futures, no up-front real Treasury is needed. In order to mitigate the effect of a bottleneck if all sellers tried to deliver the same bond at the same time, CME designed the machanism to allow to delivery a basket of bonds as followed: 

> Deliverable basket of ulter-long contract is a subset of 30-year's  
> Notional: $\$$100,000 for each, with 2y contract having $\$$200,000  
> Quoted in 32nds, e.g. 110-16+ = $\$$100 + $\$$16.5/32  

In the fixed income space, investors are seldom talking about notional and price increments, although they're useful to know for determining contract sizes. What investors care about is whether the yield can exceed NPV, how the profit will be eroded due to yield changes (duration/ convexity).
> To accurately position trades in futures, the metric needs to be risk exposure to rates, not notional.

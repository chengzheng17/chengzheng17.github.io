> Forward and futures help to reduce **exposure to volatility**

## BASICS OF FUTURES TRANSACTIONS

An attractive feature of the futures markets is the ability for a buyer or seller to get large exposure to the market with little up-front cash. The leverage can also be achieved by using **repo market**, to buy bonds on margin.

The arbitrage in bond futures market: For the buyer of a futures contract to be indifferent between owning a forward contract or the underlying asset, the price of this forward contract should be the current price of the asset minus the net cost of holding the asset (coupon - repo) between today and the forward date. But reality is not always perfect. 

In the U.S. fixed income space, there're two majot futures contracts: ***Eurodollar futures*** and ***Treasury futures***, both of which are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). See the symbols system below.

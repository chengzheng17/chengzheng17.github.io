## THE FUTURES DELIVERY OPTION

Trading the basis involves buying or selling Treasury bond (known informally as a cash Treasury) and doing the reverse trade with the Treasury futures contract. As carry can be locked using term repo, trading gross basis is equivalent to trading BNOC. 

On the delivery date, the futures contract needs to converge to the final cheapest-to-deliver (CTD) bond when the contract is *about to expire*.
